# Transformer-less-power-supply-for-Microcontrollers.
A transformer-less and low ampere power supply, working well with Arduino. PCB'S and diagrams are shared.
See all details from here : 

What if I will say about using a Transformer-less power supply for low power projects. There is no need of any SMPS or PSU. Also it is very easy to make all the data, Gerber files, PCB layouts and circuit diagram are available here. To give a better and professional looks we will use JLCPCB service to build these prototype. Yep, this project is brought to you by JLCPCB offering best quality PCB's (5pcs double layered in just $2). https://jlcpcb.com/SSRF

Components required:
1) 105/104/474K capacitor
2) 1Mohm,100ohm/10k resistor
3) 1N4007 Diodes
4) Preferred Zener diode (5v to 18v)
5) 220uF/470uF electrolytic capacitor
